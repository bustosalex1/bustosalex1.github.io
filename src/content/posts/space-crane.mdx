_Space Crane on lunar surface concept._

During summer 2019 I took a systems engineering class. One of the assignments
was a group project involving the development of a reusable lunar access
vehicle. As the name of the class suggests, the project focused on the systems
engineering aspects of such a vehicle &mdash; defining the problem through
requirements and goals, creating CONOPS, developing mission timelines, creating
interface diagrams and morphological matrices, etc.

I worked with two of my friends to create a concept architecture that we called
the "Space Crane," which was inspired, at least in design, by the Eagle
Transporter from the _Space: 1999_ TV show. I created all of the concept
architecture CAD in Fusion 360 and I designed the CONOPS diagram using Adobe
Illustrator and Photoshop. I helped out with writing some of the mission
requirements and the mission morphological matrix. I also developed a project
timeline based on timelines for NASA's Altair and James Webb Space Telescope
projects.
