### Overview

This was a project I did for a graduate class, _ME 6104: Computer Aided Design_. I wasn't really
sure what to expect from the class when I signed up for it, but I was pleasantly surprised to find
that it focused primarily on understanding some of the fundamental building blocks of modern
parametric CAD and implementing some basic concepts like Bézier curves and surfaces with Python.

For the class's final project, I worked with a classmate to write the tool shown above. It's
basically just designed to give some intuition to the way Bézier curves and surfaces work by showing
how each of the points in the curve / surface affect the value of the curve (shown by enabling the
`Indicator`) at a given point.
