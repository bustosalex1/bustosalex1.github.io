### Overview

This was a project I did for a graduate class, _ME 6104: Computer Aided Design_. I wasn't really
sure what to expect from the class when I signed up for it, so I was pleasantly surprised to find
that it focused primarily on understanding some of the fundamental building blocks of modern
parametric CAD and implementing some basic concepts like Bézier curves and surfaces with Python.

For the class's final project, I worked with a classmate to build the tool shown above. It's
basically just designed to give some intuition to the way Bézier curves and surfaces work by showing
how each of the points in the curve / surface affect the value of the curve (shown by enabling the
`Indicator`) at a given point.

For a little context, Bézier curves are made up of some number of control points, and any point
along the curve is defined entirely by the values of the control points.

$$
\bm{p}(u) = \sum_{i=0}^n f_i(u) \bm{p}_i
$$

Here, $f_i(u)$ represent **basis functions** evaluated at $u$, which, in the case of Bézier curves
are **Bernstein polynomials**, defined by the following equation.

$$
B_{i,n} = \begin{pmatrix}
n \\
i
\end{pmatrix} u^i (1-u)^{n-i}
$$
