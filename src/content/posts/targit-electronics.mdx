For a little background information, The Tethering and Ranging Mission of the
Georgia Institute of Technology (TARGIT) is a CubeSat Mission with the primary
objective of demonstrating a LiDAR imaging system on a CubeSat platform. In
order to test this imaging system, the satellite will deploy a small target
with its own power system, electronics, communications equipment, and sensors,
that will inflate a mylar balloon. This mylar balloon will serve as the target
for the satellite's imaging operations. You can read more about the project
[here](https://bgunter.gatech.edu/research/targit).

When I first started on the project in the fall of 2018, I worked on developing
some of the electronics systems for the target subsystem. The system is
centered around the TinyZero Microcontroller, which is basically just a tiny
32-bit Arduino-compatible microcontroller. I designed a motherboard for the
TinyZero (Figure 1) that features power management/distribution features and a
circuit that actuates solenoid valves to inflate the mylar balloon. I also
designed a small shield for the TinyZero that allows it to interface with a
radio transceiver. This radio transceiver is what communicates with the main
satellite.

Over the course of two semesters, I learned how to use Autodesk EAGLE to design
circuits and PCBs. I used on-campus resources, like the Mechanical Engineering
Electronics Lab, to get single sided PCBs milled to prototype with. After
validating my design, I moved on to a more compact two-sided design that was
professionally manufactured via OSHPark. I sourced all the components for the
board via DigiKey and assembled the board using a soldering iron. You can see
the progression from prototype to completed board in the images below.
