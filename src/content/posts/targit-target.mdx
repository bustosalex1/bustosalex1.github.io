### Background

For a little background information, The Tethering and Ranging Mission of the
Georgia Institute of Technology (TARGIT) is a CubeSat Mission with the primary
objective of demonstrating a LiDAR imaging system on a CubeSat platform. In
order to test this imaging system, the satellite will deploy a small target with
its own power system, electronics, communications equipment, and sensors, that
will inflate a mylar balloon. This mylar balloon will serve as the target for
the satellite's imaging operations.

### System Overview

On [another page](/posts/targit-electronics), you can see my work on the
electronics used inside the "target" subsystem. This page mostly contains my
work on the target subsystem structure and its manufacture/assembly. I started
working on the target subsystem during the summer of 2019 and continued working
on it through the spring of 2020. The target structure houses all of the
necessary systems to allow the mylar balloon I mentioned earlier to inflate so
that the main satellite can image it. This includes solar panels,
retroreflectors, batteries, a microcontroller, a pressurized gas reservoir,
valves, a hard mounting point to tether the target to the main satellite, and a
number of other systems. The poster below, which a friend and I presented at the
2019 Symposium on Space Innovations, gives a good overview of the system
operations.

In order to inflate the balloon, pressurized gas must flow from a reservoir
through air channels and valves and into the balloon. Due to the complexity of
these reservoirs and channels, the target structure is almost entirely SLA 3D
printed. The basic idea is that there is a centerbody composed of several 3D
printed parts. These parts incorporate a number of features, including a gas
reservoir, recesses for electronics and a battery, and a series of air channels.
The centerbody structure is surrounded by spring-loaded hinged panels that fold
out once the target is deployed from the main satellite. While the basic
geometric constraints of these parts were established when I began working on
the project, I ended up designing from the ground up much of the structure. The
flight hardware was outsourced to a professional 3D printing company using SLA
technology and a material with high stiffness and temperature resistance. We
actually were able to get my designs manufactured before the end of the spring
2020 semester, which was super exciting. To prototype the structure, I used a
Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D printer with standard resin. Using the same printing
technology as the professional manufacturers allowed me to see what sort of
features were possible to print and which features would be problematic.

### Future Work

The design phase for the target structure is largely complete. As mentioned
earlier, we've ordered the professionally manufactured parts and are in the
process of moving on to assembling flight hardware and testing.
