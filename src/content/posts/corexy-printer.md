This is a project I've been working on for a while. I designed and built my first 3D printer in high school, but it just wasn't great. It worked okay and produced decent prints, but it had a really large footprint and a comparatively small build volume. It also didn't have any sort of auto-bed leveling and the wire management was, well, bad. I've set out to build a few more printers since then. Some of them didn't even work, most of them never got finished, and one of them worked decently, but suffered from similar design issues as the first printer I designed. There were wires everywhere, the build area was small but the footprint was not, and the whole thing was not every aesthetically pleasing.
