### Overview

This was a project I did for a graduate class, _PHYS 6124: Mathematical Methods of Physics_. The
class covered a wide range of important math topics for physics, one of which was complex numbers
and conformal maps. I'll be honest, when I was taking the class, an intuitive understanding of
conformal maps eluded me. And at the time of writing this post, I still can't say I really
understand them that well. At the very least, I could appreciate that some prominent map projections
-- such as the stereographic projection and the Mercator projection -- were conformal.

At the time, I was just starting to explore frontend web development, and I was really interested in
D3.js, so I decided to try and tailor my final project for the class to fit in some of these
interests.

### Implementation

The project page shown above is basically intended to give some sort of greater understanding to
conformal maps by allowing users to see how different maps transition to each other, and how panning
and rotating a map affects its contents.

Ultimately, this ended up being more or less a React-based implementation of some other D3 projects
out there ([like this one](https://observablehq.com/@d3/projection-transitions)). And unfortunately,
using React was not a great experience for this particular use case and probably just
overcomplicated things. Based on my (limited) understanding of React and D3, this is basically
because React, with its virtual DOM, and D3, are both trying to control the DOM, and managing this
control between the two can get tricky. You can check out the implementation on the [project
repo](https://github.com/bustosalex1/phys-6124) to see how weird it is (or at least, how weird I
managed to make it).
