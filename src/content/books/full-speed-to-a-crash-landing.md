## Overview

Late last summer, my grandma and I went to Oregon, and we stopped by Powell's
Books. I spent some time browsing the sci-fi _floor_, and I took a ton of
pictures of books with recommendations from the Powell's staff so that I could
grab them later when I was looking for something to read. _Full Speed to a Crash
Landing_ had the following recommendation.

> If you like: Murderbot, my Martha Wells; The Wayfarers Series, by Becky
> Chambers; Heists!
