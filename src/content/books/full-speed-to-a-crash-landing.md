## Background

I read this book because I saw it in Powell's Books in Portland, with a
recommendation that said:

> If you like: Murderbot, my Martha Wells; The Wayfarers Series, by Becky
> Chambers; Heists!

And Becky Chambers is one of my favorite sci-fi authors, so I figured I'd give
it a shot.

## Summary

This is a bit fuzzy; I read this book about a month and a half ago at this
point. The story centers around Ada Lamarr whose name is, interestingly, an ode
to Ada Lovelace and Hedy Lamarr (I'd never heard of the latter until reading
this book). Ada, it appears, is basically a space scavenger, and has come across
a crashed spacecraft.

## Thoughts

I enjoyed this book; I don't know if I will pick up the next book in the series,
but it was a fun read. I can see why it's been compared to _The Wayfarers_.
