## Background

I read the first book in The Culture series, _Consider Phlebas_ last year. I
enjoyed it, although I don't think I really got the entire vibe of The Culture.
Since the book mostly focuses on Horza, who is fighting with the Idirans against
The Culture, I didn't see a ton of the whole post-scarcity high tech AI-governed
utopia that I hear the series is best known for. I guess I was interested in
some more of that, so recently I decided to pick up the next book in the series:
_The Player of Games_.

## Summary

The book follows Jernau Morat Gurgeh (I _think_, based on some dialogue, that
"Morat" literally means "player-of-games" in Marain, the dominant language in
The Culture). Gurgeh lives on Chiark Orbital (a giant ring around a star
complete with atmosphere, terrain, weather, etc.) and lives a generally solid
life. He has a healthy social life, and is known as one of the best game players
in The Culture. This doesn't really mean one specific game, just that he's
broadly good at playing a broad variety of games. In this sense, "games" mostly
seem analagous to board games or card games, although potentially augmented with
high tech pieces.

## General Thoughts

I really enjoyed this book. I was somewhat skeptical of the premise, but I was
basically hooked once the Azad tournament actually started.

## Favorite Quotes

### On blackmail in The Culture

> Where nothing could be authenticated, blackmail became both pointless and
> impossible; in a society like the Culture, where next to nothing was
> forbidden, and both money and individual power had virtually ceased to exist,
> it was doubly irrelevant.

### I just thought the phrase "God, Game, and Empire" was cool

> Here we have many rules, and try to live according to the laws of God, Game
> and Empire.

### Sounds familiar...

> It is especially important to remember that the ownership of humans is
> possible too; not in terms of actual slavery, which they are proud to have
> abolished, but in the sense that, according to which sex and class one belongs
> to, one may be partially owned by another or others by having to sell one's
> labor or talents to somebody with the means to buy them.
